HydrateTrackerApp is an intuitive iOS application designed to help users monitor their daily water intake.
Based on the userâ€™s body weight, the app calculates a personalized daily hydration goal.
Users can log their water intake, receive notifications at customizable intervals, and track their progress throughout the day.
This project uses SwiftUI and integrates local data storage for persistent user preferences, including notification settings and daily water goals.
